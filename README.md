# Hanabi

I did not create Hanabi. 


## Prerequisites
[Termcolor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor) needs to be installed in the python package.

## Playing the game
To start the game, run

`python -i hanabi/Hanabi.py`

on terminal

and type `Game()`. The game will then start up on its own. This game only works on Macs.

[Rules](http://www.gezelschapsspel.info/sites/default/files/bijlages/Hanabi_Rules_Summary.pdf)

Type exit at any time to exit the game.
